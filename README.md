# Let's Get Linear
Computer scientists often often call linear algebra easy on a good day, and boring on a bad one. While much of the subject material can certainly be smooth to learn, this repository is here to show that linear algebra is anything but boring. Rather, it's applications can be really wild and wacky!

This repository explores the linear algebra and general mathy things behind two machine learning concepts: 

1. spectral clustering 
2. singular value decomposition

Use the jupyter notebooks in each corresponding directory to learn about these topics interactively. Also, feel free to use the python files to continue exploring on your local machine.

Prior knowledge on some machine learning and linear algebra concepts is expected, as this repository is not meant to exactly teach these individual subjects; rather, it is meant to sharpen and clarify the connection between them. 

## About Me 
My name is Anisha Jain, and I'm a Math and Computer Science double major at Smith College. I'm an assistant reseracher in the software engineering lab on my campus, and some of my academic interests include graph theory and natural language processing. 

Although I have been interested in machine learning for a while, I recently formally gained skills like familiarity with sci-kit learn and numpy through a computational machine learning course that I took at Smith. I'm also familiar with some cool math concepts!

Outside of math and machine learning, I love to read cheesy books and drink tea with friends.
