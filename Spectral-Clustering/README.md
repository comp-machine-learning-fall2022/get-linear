# Let's Get Linear: Spectral Clustering

Using spectral clustering instead of a plain old k-means clustering algorithm can bring about some interesting patterns in data. Spectral clustering a form of dimension reduction with a bunch of linear algebra concepts behind it, so let's explore it! 

## Important Files
1. `spectral-clustering-notebook.ipynb` - interactive file for exploring spectral clustering
2. `spec_clust.py` - python file that contains spectral clustering functions and code for running methods locally
3. `spec_clust_data.csv` - data file for toy example
4. `test_spec_clust` - testing file for python file
