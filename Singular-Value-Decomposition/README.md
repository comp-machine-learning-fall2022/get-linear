# Let's Get Linear: Spectral Clustering

Singular Value Decomposition is a method to factor data and help reduce the dimensions of a data matrix. It's based in a lot of linear algebra like eigendecomposition and pulls from a lot of ideas about symmetric matrices and eigenvectors and eigenvalues, so let's explore it!

## Important Files
1. `singular-value-decomposition.ipynb` - interactive file for exploring singular value decomposition
2. `anime_svd.py` - python file that contains functions for an anime recommendation system using singular value decomposition for the guiding example
3. `anime.csv` and `rating.csv` - data files for guiding example
